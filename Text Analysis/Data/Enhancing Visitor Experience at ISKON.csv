But immediately upon arrival I was so moved by the beauty of this temple, which increased as we moved up the many steps through various stages of ritual and observations, that I was completely captivated (in the good sense of the word). At every step it's a rather busy and bustling place, but at the top I chose to sit down on the floor, close my eyes, and try to be silent and still my mind. Suddenly about twenty minutes later my host lightly tapped me on the shoulder and suggested it might be time for us to start heading back. Those twenty minutes for me had flown by in an instant. I think I could have sat there another hour or two, and again, I am NOT someone who would normally do that. I would definitely go back, as there is plenty to see along the way up -- beautiful carvings and monumental architecture. And on leaving, we were handed a portion of rice spiced with some amazing combination of spices that I wish I could duplicate at home. I suspect it was cardomam, cinnamon and maybe cloves, but alas, I have been unable to replicate it at home. Until you have visited it is hard to really describe the magic of this place.

On Sundays they have a Family Buffet and we decided to try this out. What an amazing experience. There must have been more than 50 dishes there. Food was prepared very well and the variety "" to die for"". from the number of people waiting in the foyer to come, it appears that this place is a favourite with local people and foreigners. The rooms were very clean and each room opened out into an ""open space"" ( not a balcony) and this is something I really treasured. As an avid traveller, one sometimes feels clausterphobic in hotel rooms. Another amazing experience was from the food sold in the stalls ( within the hotel grounds). I loved the pani puris and the pav baji among others. The main negative about foreign holiday makers staying here was the distance to Colaba. However if shopping is not your main core business but enjoying what Mumbai has to offer, then this place should be on your to do list.",4,POSITIVE

The tower above this temple is glass clad and looks beautiful both at daytime and night. Weekends could take more time because of the crowds. Also Arathi is elaborate and good to view, but may be an issue if you are in a hurry. The prasad stalls are wonderful and offer a huge variety of interesting foods. There is also a prasad seva place for a thali lunch (for those who offer special sevas). But I recommend visiting their restaurant ""The Higher Taste"" which has an elaborate buffet and a great la-carte menu. The buffet variety is huge. The food is very easy on the stomach and is also very tasty. The food is totally satvik (no non-veg, garlic, onions etc.), but the variety and interesting presentation ensures that you don't miss these.",5,POSITIVE

I have visited this temple from the year 1990 during which it has gone through radical transformation. In the 90s, this used to be a calm lovely place (well which place of Bangalore wasn't!!!) and mostly simplistic which had its serenity about it and a sense of spiritual charge. The reconstruction of the grand temple which stands today has chaged the dynamic of the place for me. It stands tall in structure and imposing in presence, but somehow seems more commercial like most temples in India are turning into. I understand the need to generate revenue for the upkeep, but the diversification into associated businesses seems to be dliuting the spiritual feel of this place as many others. Walking through the sales counters at the end of the circuit feels a bit busy and untemple like. more than a few people come there just to snack and hangout, which is all well, but also contributes to the place feeling like a mall with a temple in there. On another visit my wife was pulled outside the line to be told that she should buy a book for her salvation. This could be an isolated incident by an overenthusiastic volunteer, but it was quite forceful and therefore unpleasant. This also probably happened as she is not Indian. She is fully appreciative of India and its vibrance and follows her understanding of the Hindu principles but she felt forcefully targetted. But it is worth a visit and it still has its nice side. My review is more of what doesnt seem right. So go visit and write your positive experiences.",3,MIXED

However, its too commercialized for my taste. Maybe too flashy for my expectations of a temple. But if thats what you like then by all means, head there. I ate there as well, the food was too oily with too much spices, again not to my taste at all. I would expect a temple to be a bit more toned down, more peaceful and the food to be more ""satvik"" as promoted by the religion.

You feel great by the time you enter the temple. The temple hall is just beautiful. The wonderful carvings, the peaceful aura and the mesmerizing idols, simply artistic. We waited for the aarti which was divine indeed. Once you exit the hall, you exit through a lane where a lot of stalls have been put up. Its like a mini shopping complex out there.

The temple is impressive, but the guys selling the books next to the are where the prayers are done disturb the procedure from my point of view. It is good to know that the money spent is used for the poor to provide poor kids with meals, but at the same time quite some amount is also used to built further impressive temples. If at the end this helps the poor it is fine. The gold statues inside are really impressive. If you go there as a foreigner, note that cameras inside are not allowed (once I was allowed to take it with me, once I had to leave it with the driver - so you need to have trust in your Rikshaw driver). Same applies for shoes, you either leave it outside of the temple or with the driver as inside people are only allowed to walk with bare foot. The temple even provides some free meal. Be cautious as it can be quite spicy. I usually buy some souvenirs or scents at the temple, things are reasonably priced, so there you do not get cheated and you can make a bargain on some items while supporting the temple and the poor. I would anybody also recommend to visit the Shiv Mandir temple next to the Leela Hotel on Old Airport Road. It provides a nicer spiritual experience. The Bull temple is nice as well (but much smaller and it does by far not provide the same spiritual experience as the Shiva Mandir or the ISKON) and somehow the guys there always try to rip me off.

It observes very strict rules. You are allowed to enter only with full trousers or Dhoti, fully covered shoulders and waist. No shoes. No camera. You have to deposit them at a cost. You have to deposit money and pay laundry charges for borrowing a Dhoti. All said and done, this place is worth visit.Visited September 2014",5,POSITIVE

I have availed Rs. 300 pass (which is valid for 6 adult people).The special pass allows you to visit the deities from near as well as they help you to perform puja for you (you can provide your name and gotra). Also, pass gives you as many prasadam laddus as there are adult people (like if you visit 6 members you will six prasadam laddus) as well as it gives a discount of Rs. 70 on any book purchased from there.You can stay there as long as you want and spend some time in meditation as well. While going out you can find various types of items - decorative, ornamental, clothing, food items etc - which is entirely from ISKCON related stuff. One more thing, do not forget to pick your free prasadam of pongal (a.k.a khichdi).",5,POSITIVE

Iscon foundation deals with great charity services, like food for the school kids, who belongs to poor background across the world! This is one of the main reasons, people love Iscon, in spite of the the fact that temple look very commercialized! Location Advantage: Iscon is located in a part of Bangalore which is well developed, its recommended to visit Orion Mall, Not far from the city railway station/Bus station (and also the upcoming metro terminal). Structure: The entire iscon area is not Green, but completely paved with concrete , granite and marble. Iscon temple is on top of a small hill and hence, if we are going there by public transport (bus), then we have to climb the steps. But if we are on our private vehicles, we can go there with an entry pass (parking), to the top to avoid the climbing. Inside the Temple: Most of the time, there will be a long queue (minimum length of 0.5 Km), until we reach the shrine. The same Queue shall be followed to come out of the temple. The queue to the exit is totally commercialized, making the disciples and visitors walk a longer way until they come out of the temple. All this far, we have options to buy Goodies, sweets, Ayurvedic stuffs, and other souvenirs. The disciples and priests are well behaved and down to earth people, which is one point to be noted. Note: - Mobile phones with Camera and Cameras are not allowed inside the temple. There is also Frisking as in airport where we need to even declare these items. Cameras can be surrendered with a nominal fees, and can be taken back on returning.

The question to the ISKCON folks who bother to answer poor reviews on this site: Why are there shops and eateries BEFORE entering the sanctum?

The priests are very well-trained and well-'versed' (no pun intended). The food is strictly vegetarian and very tasty. The premises are very clean. The one MAJOR problem with the temple facility is that they're overly fussy about photography and do not allow even family events (such as weddings) to be photographed. I find that ridiculous, especially for such once-in-a-lifetime events of loved near-and-dear ones. Also, what harm could possibly occur when flash-less pictures are taken, of the temple and its premises?! The variety of goods that are available for sale in the temple is huge, and spectacular. Those are a bit overpriced, though, and not adequate discounts are given to customers that make purchases of many items at once.

Inside there are guards who will ask couples to sit apart and not face each other/ hold hands etc. Once you exit, the exit path is compulsorily through the commercial market/ complex which is just never-ending. Only after finishing your tour through the marketplace (right beneath the temple premises), you reach the prasad that is the famous ISKCON khichadi (that is the only nice part). Even if you are impressed by the temple n all, the market is a huge put off and spoils the mood instantly. This is the only ISKCON I have seen which has a such a huge market area.

Shoes need to be stored against a small fee and also if you carry bags and camera's this needs to be stored before you may enter the temple. Entrance is not free for tourists, but is worth to pay.

The place can get very crowded during festival days. elders and people with health issues will find it difficult, as they will have to walk for sometime and will need to climb up some steps to get to the main temple.They do have some provision to reduce the number of steps, but cannot avoid that in entirety.

The place is highly commercialized, with lots of shops selling souvenirs, photos, vanity items etc...There are many eateries selling snacks and soft drinks. there is a Jain restaurant outside which serves Jain friendly food.

2333,Trip Advisor,Kishan G,9/22/15,?A divin place for peace and pray.?,"A very well maintained place. I am not a religious person at all and I went here with my family because I had heard so much about this place and it happened to be close to where we were staying and we had a whole day with nothing else to do and so we decided to give this place a try. And I'm glad that I did. After a few minutes in this place something started bothering me, something that was not quite what you would expect in a temple and I couldn't put my finger on it. And then it hit me! This place is CLEAN! And no SMELL!! No beggars at the entrance!!! The cleanliness is something that you do not associate with temples usually. There, I have said it. Sad, but true. Let us face the truth....temples are not very clean because you usually see rotting fruits, coconuts and flowers being thrown around and temples usually have a peculiar but unique smell (like our railway stations. You can smell a railway station before you reach it). ISKCON is squeaky clean and only has a pleasant smell. That is a big plus in my book. There is a constant, repetitive, droning chant going on over the discreetly placed public address system. You can not escape it. It follows you everywhere like Mary's little lamb. If you like such things, you'll find it quite peaceful and divine. For me it got old in a hurry and started driving me a little crazy after an hour or so. Well, that's just my opinion. You may find the droning voice quite soothing. They have a big area selling some nice posters, statuettes, lovely T shirts and other trinkets. There is a big walk-around restaurant where they sell very good, tasty meal for a very reasonable price. This place was not that clean but I think you should blame it on the people who visit and not the management. Even though there are many dustbins some people were dumping their plates where they stood and not in the bins. But I think we will learn to keep our public places clean very soon. Like in a million years. I mean, what is the big hurry? As you leave, they give you prasadam which is quite tasty. They give it in a disposable cup and again our people just eat and dump those cups all over the place except in the dustbins. Only these two areas are not so clean (even though the employees/volunteers keep picking up the discarded food plates). Give this place a try. You will need at least 2-3 hours inside.",4,MIXED

( as all families consist!) But all of us enjoyed the outing . There are elaborate arrangements for storage of your footwear and an ingenious system for washing the feet of the devotees as you walk in... The architectural marvel is right in the heart of the city. For the devout, there is definitely the ""presence"" the ambiance of the Supreme Being, amidst all the hustle and bustle of the crowd and the some-what un-subtle commercialization. If you are going because you are a firm devotee, please select a less crowded time like early mornings or afternoons, certainly not evenings in the week end.. There is a separate circuit for the believers, where you move from step to step chanting the prayer, which is moving and thought provoking, if you have the time. Don't get into that loop if you are there for a quick dekko and exit. There is a VIP darshan, which is not fair to the regular devotees, but alas, a fact of life. Also the commercialization could be made a bit more unobtrusive..... Otherwise we really soaked up the atmosphere and the magnificence and opulence of the deities.

They make you chant the krishna mantra which you will start repeating it without your consciousness and I guess thats when you feel the Krishna Consciousness. Cleanliness is seen every where in the temple which takes it close to godliness. The view of god from the big doors makes you feel the darshan realistic and decoration of the idol is beyond words.

The exit passage takes you to the food court and you can purchase prasad along the way. They also distribute khichdi as prasad. The place is best visited during early mornings and evenings.

2820,Google + HK HILL,Akash Motamarri,3/2/16,,"ISKCON was founded by Prahalad prabhupada, from Calcutta whom decided to spread Krishna's words. It is a very religious place, with many rules and very little freedom to experiment one's individual spirituality. At the entrance you will find devotees promoting Pooja coupons and trying to sell offerings for Krishna, as well as cloak rooms to leave the camera and other bags. There's a lot of security checking and guards which are quite strict... All this sort of kills the enchantment of the place... But I guess its still interesting to see the shrine. After the Pooja, visitors and devotees receive 'prasadam' in a leaf cup. And at the exit, you will find plenty of opportunities to buy gadgets, souvenirs, sweets, books. There are different shrines dedicated to Radha and Krishna. The main temple with the golden shrine has ceiling paintings with Krishna's childhood events. This is more a place where community religion is practised. In the evening, bhajans are played and devotees dance at the shrine.",5,POSITIVE

2615,Trip Advisor,Prarthana M,3/3/16,"visit to Iscon,Bangalore","An architectural masterpiece. A landmark for the city. A must visit for all people alike. The entire place literally transports you to a different world, full of devotion and reflection. The entire temple complex would need to be consumed through your eyes, mind and spirit, and this would need plenty of time, patience, bhakti and energy. The main prayer hall is huge and is an experience to sit through bhajans and/or pooja performances. Books, trinkets, take aways, and a myriad other Krshna products along with the rosaries and the prasadam can well be very good souvenirs for posterity. There are lots of shops selling t shirts to pens to food and one could pay attention to how they relate to the KRSHNA Consciousness and purchase accordingly. It can be quite annoying if someone is not ready, when volunteers seek donation for their several food schemes. If you have the time, just as you step out, you may seek to visit their Akshaya Patra operations area to see the massive meal scheme they run to feed millions of children. Amazing work!

2387,Trip Advisor,VIBHUTIDelhi,3/25/16,VERY GOOD,"Van de tempels die ik bezocht heb was dit verreweg de grootste. Ik was er op goede vrijdag, een vrije dag in India en de belangstelling was overweldigend. Met zijn vieren konden we voor 1000 roepies een VIP pas kopen. Daarmee heb je met maximaal 6 personen toegang tot de hele tempel en word je om de rijen heen geleid. En rijen waren er. Na twee kleinere tempels kom je terecht in wat ik de hoofdtempel zou noemen. Wie in de rij gestaan heeft is nu eindelijk bij zijn doel aangekomen. Wij werden verwezen naar een wachtruimte en verzocht te gaan zitten. Uiteindelijk stonden we vlak voor het altaar. Priesters voerden daar een ritueel op en daarna kregen we een bloem voor achter het oor. Ondanks dat ik weinig van de religie weet een indrukwekkende ervaring. Minder vond ik wat daarna kwam. Niet de uitleg van wat Hare Krishna nu inhoudt, maar wel de enorme hoeveelheid stands met Merchandise. Menig professionele voetbalclub zou er wat van kunnen leren. Zelf ben ik nog opgevoed met het beeld van Jezus die de handelaren de tempel uit sloeg... De opbrengst schijnt wel naar een goed doel te gaan. Maar de ""gemiddeld"" is er een uitvloeisel van. Al met al toch wel een spirituele ervaring. Wel was ik blij met het advies van onze chauffeur om de schoenen vast in de auto te laten. Voor mijn gevoel scheelde dat een hoop gedoe na afloop.",5,POSITIVE

However the 300 rupee entrance seemed to be paying for this and also a bag of Indian sweets/ biscuits and a free devotional book !I was prayed over and made to feel welcome despite being a woman visiting on her own. There are notices saying no photography or cameras and in fact my camera had to be left with security even though I would not have used it. as is normal in Hindu temples no shoes , but it is not clear where to leave them although there is in fact a large cloakroom for them. I f you get lost the ground can be scorching as you find your way - take socks. I accepted the free rice and tried to eat correctly but failed miserably. It felt rude to refuse. There are lots of things to buy but you do not have todo so and I never felt pressurised. I have seen similar goods in many western cathedrals. But.

One can buy the Bhagawad Gita by Swami Prabhupada translated into various regional languages. There is very tight security. The place is very cleanly maintained. Cameras are not allowed - but there are cloak rooms to leave your camera and collect them on the way out. A large number of steps need to be taken to reach the sanctum sanctorum - elderly people could find it difficult - but I think there are special darshan passes to avoid the steps (not sure - saw some signages about special darshan at extra cost).

2928,Trip Advisor,Dr. Varma R,6/1/16,Ehhhh,The chiming of bells can be heard from half a kilometre away inspite of the madenning cacophany of the infamous Bangalore traffic. You but cannot help to dwell into where your life is heading to in the rat race? This is a motivation enough for you to climb the staircase of the temple and what follows is but a fantastic date with God. The climb up to the temple sanctum sanctorum is a circuitous route and designed to heighten your sense of awareness and belonging with 'Him'. Though the place is fully commercialised yet you cannot miss his presence. Omnipresent. You can hear the chanting Hare Rama Hare Krishna all the way up and beyond. I strongly advise to sit with your eyes closed and feel him as you reach the sanctum. There will be pushing and hustling but the inner peace you experience post that is unimaginable. For the connoisseurs of satvic food there is a satvic hotel that will add to the mystism of your visit. All in all iskcon is one place in Bangalore that can pull you back to human roots.

Private Cards can go upto a specific point. Better to avoid camera's as you have to keep them with authorities at a specific starting point. There is one toilet at the strting point and then directly at the exit point. Chappals also need to be stored with them, however it is done very systematically without any kind of problems. It is a great architectural work and you can also read the history while in the queue. The main idols are in the huge main hall called ""Hari Naam Kirtan"".

If you have limited time in Bangalore than better not to prioritize it. As it is, Bangalore traffic takes up a lot of travel time and then the temple security and formality have to be complied with. Even when not crowded, the compulsion to repeat the mantra at every step before entering the darshan hall creates slow moving queues without adding any spiritual value. (Can any enforced experience ever be spiritual ? ) After all this ,the architecture and art aren't extraordinary. The main darshan hall does have lovely golden decor and beautifully painted ceiling but then so do most big temples, along with better gardens, carving, history and less hassle. The exit is a long ,winding route through a "" big bazaar"" of religious items , books and a huge ( and yummy ) variety of food counters.

The temple is well maintained and has Tirupathi Balaji and prahaladha Narasimha deities apart from the main deity of Krishna . They have good parking facility . The main temple is wonderfully architected. As always as any other ISKCON, it has a lot of stalls for sales of books and other stuff . There was a book stall near the darshan place , which could have been avoided for free movement of pilgrims after darshan .

2984,Trip Advisor,NKS1953,6/15/16,PLACE FOR PEACE AND HARMONY,"There is something unique about the concept of Darshan. When we go to temples we go so that we can see the Lord and for him to see us. The sight of our dear Lord purifies us, strengthens us, brings us closer to Him. Sri Krishna, the supreme Lord in his grace, out of pure love for us his devotees allows us to approach easily to establish a loving relationship with him. ISKCON and Srila Prabhupad have done a great favour to humanity by establishing the Hare Krishna temples so that we may have an easy access to Lord Krishna. The temple in Bangalore is an amazing piece of architecture no doubt, but my attachment to the place rests in the fact that it is one of the great places where you can go and chant Mahamatra, sing Kirtans and have the lord's Darshan to your hearts content.

The place is no doubt too huge, well-maintained and calm. But what surprised me was the big display board with the prices for some offerings or prayers, the loooong queue which we could happily escape by entering from in-between through some influence which my friend had and most importantly the exit way in the building which is filled with shops selling eateries, books, CDs and other stuffs. One might feel that all the things I mentioned above will be there in most of the temples, why exaggerate for ISKCON, again, it's what I felt when I visited and purely my opinion. So you might or might not feel this as commercialized temple. The God's idol/statute is not in the south-Indian style but is that of North-Indian style, i.e, the white idols. The hall is huge and nice. One thing that you shouldn't miss when you go to this place is to have food at 'Higher Taste'.

With all due respect, I prefer this place as a visit spot and not very much as temple. You have shopping area, food Court inside the premises. You will also meet temple priest who will teach you the way to please God. Well everyone has their own definition of God and devotion and so have mine. A good place to be with family without any concern. But you go there.. Do not miss the morning Aarti and the Prasadam they give to all the devotees.

Ridiculous Only positive is the restaurant there which has very good food but even that is not light on your pocket. Rates than can easily match a decent 4 star restaurant.

It was a Saturday and I had visitors from another country interested in going to ISKCON so we planned and left Koramangala at 11.00am. By the time we reached the location it was nearing 2.30pm. I would blame this time laps on weekend rush. Then we went in to the temple from one side after buying the tickets. The structure was plain white. And it looked more plain and angular then the usual structural beauty of Indian temples. We took the tour and I tried to absorb as much as i can but frankly speaking I was just waiting to leave due to the crowd. we finally managed to reach the place where they serve food.

You have to climb a lot of stairs to reach the main temple as well as pass through a couple of other smaller temples. The location of the temple is perfect. It is bang opposite the Sandal Soap factory and has become a landmark in itself. Close-by, you have the Orion Mall as well as the Sheraton Hotel. You have to pass through two security checks before you start the ascent to the temple. One at the entrance and the other after you deposit your bags and shoes. The entire system is very organized with volunteers and sevaks guiding you till you reach the top. The inner sanctum reverberates with the auspicious chants of ""Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare"". Listening to this chant, makes you feel at peace with yourself. After taking darshan of the Lord, you have to pass through a long route which is lined with the activities of the ISKCON group viz Books, Akshay Patra details etc. They also have a mini-theater which was showing animated films with respect to Lord Krishna. After darshan, you get prasadam which is generally a rice-based hot khicdi. Keep in mind that you will be allowed entry only if you are dressed in proper clothing. No shorts/three-fourths allowed for gents. Overall, you may spend approximately one hour in the temple premises with delays only during peak times like evening aartis.",3,NEGATIVE

When we were there, it was full house so the special entry pass gave us our space and we got to walk according to our pace. I hope that made sense.

3359,Trip Advisor,NguyenAnT,9/6/16,Ikea styled temple with lots of money grabbing enterprises,"I am not very religious in the sense that I am not one to worship too many idols and believe in rituals. I went to this temple purely as a tourist. I did not expect the visit to be so time-consuming; I mean, after all it is just a temple and if you do not sit down to pray and all, how long should it take. But I was wrong. They move inside the temple one step at a time on each ""Hare Rama Hare Krishna"" chant. This means that you take at least 20-25 minutes just to enter the temple. The temple is very beautiful and grand. The chants and music are very soothing and calms you down. The whole atmosphere is very enigmatic if you ignore the very in-your-face commercial aspect of the temple. (They are selling books and hoardes of other stuff - even the prasadam - at every corner). Overall a good experience but nothing worth remembering for very long.",1,NEGATIVE

3374,Trip Advisor,devverma,9/11/16,Hare Rama Hare Krishna.. Such a Pious Place,"ISKCON Temple: It is one of the most popular temples, particularly of the recent past. It has a top quality management, which manages the temple on professional lines. On normal days you will find crowds entering through the main gates will be able to drive through almost till the main entrance to the temple. The temple is located over a hilly-land area of aprox 7-8 Acres, this was just another hill which was transformed into this amazing temple by the efforts of the temple committee. It incorporates a wonderful synthesis and fusion of traditional temple architecture with modern principles of construction and civil engineering. When you access the temple premises by foot, you will initially reach a footwear leaving place where you can deposit your footwear and walk further up to the actual temple environs. You will notice that most of the pathway is protected against rain and hot sun for those special days. You will soon be at the very entrance to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple where you will be faced with two options of going through the 108 rounded steps wherein you can enjoy the charm of reciting the Hare Krishna mahamantra on each step while waiting for the Queue to move forward, and this will be an enjoyable experience which is relished by many. Alternately, you can also by-pass this and use the other direct route, if you are short of time, wherein you can go to the Sri Prahlada Narasimha Swamy temple by the side route. When you enter the Sh. Laxmi Narasimha Swamy temple you will be struck by the awesome beauty and the amazing sculpture work of the main deity over here, you will want to stare at it to eternity and will be lost in spiritual ecstasy, however, life must move on and the crowds behind you would also want to have a glimpse of the Lord, and so they will usher you to the next temple. Do remember to pay your obeisance/worship to the Deities of Garudadeva and Shri. Hanuman on either side at the entrance of the Narasimha shrine. You will now be at the entrance of the Shri Srinivasa Govinda Temple where you will once again be mesmerized by the outstanding fineness and excellence of the sculpture work and you will feel as if you have been magically and suddenly tranlocated to Tirupati. After you enjoy the reverberations of Govinda, Govinda, you will now head to the main temple. The vast main hall on level 3 is accessed by wide steps with banisters and has a beautiful gold plated altar, with attractive interior designs and a ceiling with huge paintings, which are held together from the roof down, depicting the pastimes of Lord Krishna with His devotees. There is an all round internal balcony which gives a view of the temple sanctum sanctorum and this adds to the glamour and beauty of this place and also gives a birds eye view for the people during festivities when the crowds are spilling into the streets a kilometer or two long on occassions like Janmashtami etc. Everyday thousands of devotees from various parts of India and other countries visit the temple to seek the blessings of Their Lordships. At the main temple you will be bewitched by extraordinary beauty of The Presiding Deities in the temple Sri Radha Krishnachandra, Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Nitai Gauranga (Sri Nityananda Prabhu and Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu). After having prayed to their lordships to your hearts content, remember to offer your respects to the most beautiful bronze sculpture of Srila Prabhupada who is peacefully witness to all the goings on in the temple and who guides the same by his divine presence. You will also see the endless rows of books by Srila and other devotees which are available for sale. If possible one should take this opportunity to contribute towards a life membership of ISKCON which will also feed millions of children in schools through the Akshaya Patre (endless supply of food, originally given by Lord Surya the Sun God to Yudhishtira, the Pandava King) program. While you allow all these things to soak into your mind and body, get back to Planet Earth and head towards the exit you will find lots of shops and sales points where every type of devotional stuff and vegetable eatery is available to satiate your taste buds, do check them out if you are in a hurry to move to the next location on your itinerary, otherwise head straight to the Higher Taste Restaurant in the same premises to eat like the Kings & his courtiers, see review separately for The Higher Taste Restaurant.",5,POSITIVE

3380,Trip Advisor,Vijayendra R,9/12/16,Place for worship and food,"Last time when I visited Bangalore decades ago, ISKCON temple was not there. This time when I visit Bengaluru, Bengaluru has several gems in its crown and ISKCON temple indeed deserves a central attention place. It's an admirably treat for eyes for devotees and tourists alike. Beautifully crafted architecture and design, craftsmanship, Grand Idols of RadhaKrishna & ors. Maybe you have seen lots of other ISKCON temples in other parts of India and probably all appear same. Even then if you are in Bengaluru, don't miss ISKCON. Give it one hour minimum, if you can. Krishna is going to be a nice experience and feel. Please Don't opt for special Darshanam. Move as a common simple man and enjoy Krishna's Consciousness in everyone you see, then, may be for a split second, you may feel it is Krishna Consciousness in you too. In case you want to offer any puja etc then you may buy the same at prescribed counter by tendering prescribed amount and obtain a receipt. Besides devotional feature, equal emphasis is on Marketing feature. You can Sell God in India. Incredible India it is. May be our great seers like Swami Prabhupad or Acharya Rajneesh never even wildly imagined in their life times that they themselves are Saint Peter of Today's Vatican. But one thing whatsoever they sell, let it be books, audio, idols, souvenirs, every piece is beautifully crafted and produced. You will not regret for quality of products. There is a free kitchen besides other selling points for a variety of delicacies of India. The kitchen provides free food to whosoever comes to eat and trust me the food is simply delicious. Here in this complex, I fear one of the big shortcoming is parking. Lots and lots of tourists visit and parking space for vehicles is going to be a big issue, if not attended in time.

So, to appease those refugees he decided to take incarnation as sanyasi so that those poor refugees accept his path and become happy. So, all landless refugees will accept Vaishnavism dharma and in performing that dharma, refugees will feel themselves happy and satisfied because rituals, rules and regulations of this dharma will be similar to the condition of their life style.

Mayapur was the fertile area because he knew that refugees will assemble around Mayapur area and refugees will be so poor that their life style will be similar to that of a Vaishnav.

Profit is not the motive, even the food that is left at the end of the day is distributed to charity. And If you are not at all interested in this 'God' n 'Prasadam' stuff, then this will work for U, ""you can have finger licking, awesome vegetarian food which is not too pricey"" Go at once and you will feel the difference.",5,POSITIVE
4128,Trip Advisor,FatMaster,1/25/17,Higher Taste is really higher,"Its a privilege to write a review on ISKCON Temple, Bangalore. I had been here for at least 5 times by now. Love this temple a lot. ISKCON is very far from where I am staying, but it is the beauty of the temple which made me visit so many times. The temple is located on a hill and this is clearly visible from the entry gate itself. It is a very big temple. There is a barricade at the entrance of the temple where we must stand in a queue to enter the main gate. From there, we climb up some slope. After climbing, a counter will be there where we have to deposit our mobiles and slippers. Once we do, we move on. Here starts the queue. It is very long, we climb the steps and move on. There is greenery to the left hand side where we go in the queue. Inside the temple, firstly we shall have darshan of ""Sri Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy"". The statutes are built very beautifully. Secondly, darshan of ""Sri Venkateshwara Swamy"" will be done. Again, the beauty of the deity is not to be missed. Finally, we reach the mandir of ""Lord Sri Krishna"" which is on the top. Awesome design, the crowd, the silence, charisma of Lord Sri Krishna will surely attract any tourist. Lord Krishna will appear in 3 screens, the middle one being Radha and Krishna. Whenever I come to ISKCON, I will surely sit and meditate here for at least 15 minutes. Once darshan is done, we move on to shopping arcade. Before that, there is a screen which shows how our soul moves in different bodies (child, adult, married man, old man, etc). There is huge shopping arcade as well as eatery. After shopping, we can find the place where we can have free meals. Also, there is a fountain where we can have a photo shoot or sit for some time and chit chat. We move on to collect our belongings (mobile, slippers) and disperse and REVISIT.",5,POSITIVE

4163,Trip Advisor,JeevanHT,2/1/17,"Good place to visit, but Didn't give me a Feel that i was in a Temple.","This is a large and beautiful temple. Unlike many temples we have visited in India, it is not ancient. It was completed, I believe, in the 1990s. It is very beautiful and quite large. It is the largest eat ISKCON temple in India and one of the largest ISKCON temples in the world. The views of the city from the climb to the temple were very nice. The visit is a self-guided tour with signs explaining various areas, beliefs, rituals, etc. of the Krishna belief. We went in a Sunday night. I think I remember it is open until 8:30pm on Sun. This was a good time to go, as there were not many locals there and basically no tourists. Also, it is cooler at night than during the day. The views of the city at night were also nice. Although entry is free, if one is a foreigner, they try to get you to pay (around $12US) for the ""short-cut"" line. This might be worth it when there are lots of people there, but I have been told even it can be very crowded. Once in either the long or short line, one must remove and leave their shoes in a bag for pick up afterward. This cost a few rupees. There are also other points along the way requiring, or urging additional fees. All told, including if one pays for the short-cut, maybe $25-$30US). On the way out, there are lots of little booths selling all manner of items. All in all, I'd say it's a definite ""should see"" if one is in Bangalore.",3,NEGATIVE

Taking metro can be an option now but then depends on your starting location.if you are coming with elderly people or people with disability, they have a special lift to take you close to the main temple, circumventing the long queue (but would request not to find loophole and misuse this facility).The main sanctum is amazingly decorated and one can spend hours in this place. Best way to spend sometime here, is to move away from the main darshan space and occupy the main courtyard, from where you can get a good view of the gods and also won't be pushed away by the security and temple authority. The way out of the temple has lots of art work and also the eating place (my favorite).

4261,Trip Advisor,RaoAdvocate,2/14/17,Relax your mind,"We visited this temple on the recommendation of many others who had visited before. It, unfortunately, was not to my family and my liking. The temple was far too commercialized. After queuing up in a dated, cramped, fenced off area, once you are through to go in, you pay to put your shoes away, bags away, and I even ended up having to pay a refundable deposit for a shawl to cover my legs up (don't wear shorts, or skirts without something to cover your legs when visiting), plus a further few rupees to cover laundry costs. Once inside, you are rushed through in order to keep the queues flowing. A priest blessed those who offered donation, but abruptly stopped when he felt more donations were required. Once inside the main temple, you are offered the chance to get to the front for a fee. Otherwise you continue to queue at a distance and be ushered through and told to keep moving along. Once you have visited, you are led out through an endless gift shop, which seems bigger than the temple! Prasad was free (!) and generous however. If you want something to tick off the list, then this is a good place to visit, but it left us feeling rather frustrated and we took the decision to avoid the bigger temples after this.",5,POSITIVE

You are required to wear appropriate clothing which includes having neither your shoulders nor legs visible. I had not done my due diligence and I showed up in shorts. After selling me a ticket for 500 rupees (apparently I needed a special access ticket different from most people), they told me they would supply me with appropriate garments. Sure enough after the luggage and shoe check and just before the entrance they rented me a wrap around to cover my legs. 20 rupees + 500 rupee refundable deposit. I appreciate that they had this available as I do wish to respect their place of worship. The people were all helpful and friendly, showing me how to tie the wrap around. It was odd being in a line and along a different path than 99% of the visitors. The special entry pass allowed viewing of 5 separate areas and participation in a short ceremony that included hand washing, touching of flowers and changing. It also included a couple of gifts including a yummy snack, a book written in Kannada and a box I haven't opened yet. From early on in my visit I had a strong feeling of cognitive dissonance. Later in more tour I have explicit issues I can identify that caused it but the feeling started before any of these. Specifically, after the main tour there is an area with signage explaining the Krishna religion. Two struck me, one was of a fish in a beach chair (labeled fish out of water), I definitely identified with that fish. Another explained how it was material things could not lead to happiness or clear thinking. After passing this area I passed through the most extensive set of gift shops, shopping areas and food sales I have ever seen in a religious institution. Towards the end the was an odd juxtaposition of signs for a paid lunch and others for a free lunch. At the very end they were offering a free bowl of some type of porridge. I feel I offended them by not accepting but by that point I was anxious to leave. This temple really is an outstanding piece of architecture and the people seemed genuinely friendly and helpful.

ISKCON is a very popular destination accessible by Metro, Public transport, Auto,and Cabs, planing to take your car - well there is plenty of parking space. As you enter the huge and sprawling complex - Everything is organized very well. There is an orderly queue system - .after completing the mandatory security check, First you get a darshan of Lord Narasimha followed by a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara. Finally you climb to the top of the hill and enter the main temple to view Lord Krishna and Radha. The golden sanctum sanctorum, the marble flooring, the colorful paintings on the walls makes the darshan a great experience. After the darshan, there are many things to do in the temple complex - you can view a animation film on Krishna in the theater or you can visit the innumerable shops to buy the various products on sale - statues, photos, books and many other items. There are many food stalls and also a restaurant. You can even buy cakes (egg less of course). And before leaving you can favour the prasad, which is delicious. Maintenance of the temple is excellent, the place is very clean and everything is well organized. A very important thing to note about ISKCON is its Akshay Patra scheme. ISKCON provides free food to lakhs of school going children as a part of the mid-day meal scheme. The maintenance of kitchen, the cleanliness, use of modern cooking technology and logistics is amazing. If you wish to be a donor or be part of any of their programs you can approach the temple authorities. If you are in Bangalore, make sure you visit ISKCON. You can easily spend a couple of hours in peace, getting the blessings of the Lord Krishna and also having a relaxing time. After the darshan of Lord Krishna and various other temple within the same complex, ISKCON also has vegetarian restaurant, the food served is Sathvik, a very good place for the vegetarians, seating arrangement is good (loved the sofas) and the service is satisfying, calm n peaceful ambience, with bhajans in the background, they have a very good variety in Buffet dinner starting from starters to deserts. The taste is good like I mentioned earlier service is at its best. They never haunt around you while eating but when you need them they will be in front of you very quickly. Overall, I definitely recommend this place and I have been a devotee of ISKCON for over 20 years now.",5,POSITIVE

First thing first, they have ample parking so no need to worry - one has to somehow reach beating traffic in Bangalore. The way they have constructed four temples (one above the other) is a visual treat. The main temple has a lot of place to sit and enjoy the spiritual music. What follows after darshan is something many people may not like but I was fine. First, one has to necessarily go through all the spiritual / book stalls and then one will see a lot of food on sale. It is like a mall in my opinion. The only complain i have is the temple authorities should mention at the top itself the free food is served at the very end. What really happens is people get excited after looking at a lot of food options and they end up eating after which they have no appetite to enjoy the deliciously free meals.

4712,Google + HK HILL,Sreedevi Kr,4/15/17,NA,"Well the title says it all. This place is well barricaded, well maintained by the sevaks/security personnel who in turn guide the devotees to the main temple. Though it feels a little frustrating as you have to walk a long way up to the main temple but as you reach the main temple mere darshan of holy god takes away all your tiredness. I did not liked the way ISKCON is marketing Krishna but it's my personal view. This place is good for people who are able to walk properly and balance themselves as there's a lot of push and pull due to huge crowd gatherings. The free prasadam counter is at a very narrow corner. The temple trustee may rethink of moving it. I have visited the temple more than couple of times but will advise people/bhakts to avoid Sunday's or any special holy day since its overcrowded and it leads to fracas between the temple securities/sevaks who maintain the huge queues and even at the pvt. car entrance. For aged people although they have offered wheel chair service but it will be good if they provide sevaks to push the wheel chairs as well. Overall the experience of visiting this place is heavenly as you enter the garbha gruha or main temple you forget all your complaints,that's the beauty of god. So just a word of advice try avoid this place on overcrowded days and don't take aged people along with you who can't walk properly. The views are entirely personal not meant to be hurt anyone.

One funny thing he forgot to mention though was that we had to walk barefoot from the parking lot, all the way to the temple. We didn't mind it though. A tip, leave your shoes in your car instead of leaving it in the repository as there are too many visitors and you risk losing your shoes or getting them mixed up, alternately you can stuff your shoes in your bag. Bring some wet ones to wipe off your dusty feet after the visit. The temple was majestic. Intricately designed all over. Going up the main staircase gave us a view of the lower parts of the temple, the roofs stunningly encased in gold! Inside the temple, we got to sit in the middle of a group of meditating and chanting visitors. Truly gave us a positive vibe. As we exited the place, we were led to a small bakeshop where all authentic Indian sweets and pastries were sold at cheap prices. We also liked the souvenir shop with the quaint books and trinkets.",5,POSITIVE

I am not sure if there is a formal dress code notice. But being a place of worship, it is best to be in decent attire. I went there during non-peak hours. It also wasn't during the festive season, so it was not very crowded. Quite a bit of walk is involved as the temple complex is quite huge. The Hare Krishna chanting in the temple is pleasant. Food (like eggless cakes, savouries and sweets) is awesome inside the complex and is sold at very reasonable rates (other than the 'prasadam' which is of course offered free to all devotees). Besides there are quite a few shops selling art work and crafts (like Tanjore paintings, religious idols, incense sticks, sandalwood scented items, souvenirs).

On a Sunny day this could be a tad tiring. To start with, they have a very good arrangement of securing your slippers in. You can also opt for a locker where you can secure your valuables though i prefer not to carry any except a mobile phone (which is almost a body part these days) which also needs to be secured in a locker. You have to climb some steps to reach the top of the hill, where main abode, the hall for Krishna temple, Bhajans and meditation are all there. The first feeling is like a WOW!!! You can feel the bliss and the energy of all like minded people doing one thing - Praying and some trying to connect to inner self. Few things you will notice here are the cleanliness, greenery are outstanding. I think they truly believe cleanliness is next to godliness. Don't forget to collect the Prasadams on your way out. There are few shops on your way out, which sell a lot of literature about Lord Krishna and more. A few more shops for other religious and fancy purchases. A Very Godly Service they provide is through the Akshayapatra Foundation - I have been myself part of some Akshayapatra Service through CSR in my company and cant tell you how Fulfilling it is to see the free mid-day meal service being served to deserving kids across India. You can be a part of it once you enquirer there. Overall, Excellent and Truly blissful experience.",5,POSITIVE

I was made to feel very welcome and special even. There were hundreds of devotees there as well and the experience was very interesting and humbling as the people were clearly very devout and focused on their prayer.

Also you wont have any problems of any sort of request for offerings from the priests. They are well prepared if there is a rush. There is a big space allocated for keeping shoes and belongings. However if girls are going sleeveless then they will have to purchase/rent a shawl type stole, since the dress code is strict. Once you are inside the temple, taking of photographs is prohibited. Before entering the main temple of Krishna, you will be visiting the smaller temples of Shri Narasimha and Shri Venkatesh. Before entering the main temple, do look around from the top since the view is splendid (if you during a festival you might see fireworks which are awesome). The view is comparable to that of Birla Mandir in Hyderabad. Inside the temple there is a big hall with very nice paintings/carvings on the roof. The main temple has three chambers of deities. Everything is well managed and the Darshan is in a linear fashion. After the darshan in a line, you can sit in the specified place in front of the main chambers. Thereafter you will be going out the exit with various stalls of religious books and the volunteers will enlighten you on their programs if you are interested to go forward with it. After the exit downwards, you will get various shops of things to buy or eat. Thereafter before going to the fountain area you will get Prasadam. You can take a few pics in the fountain area where from the main temple is in view. After wards you can exit and at the exit there is a restaurant if you would like to eat. Bonus tip : One of the best malls of Bangalore is also nearby - Orion Mall - It has got everything in a mall (even Starbucks) and at the backside is a small artificial lake and am phi theater, sometimes musical fountain with lights is also there.

Temple is closed between 1 pm to 4 pm. 2.Senior citizens can opt for lift facility . Wheel chairs available for physically challenged. 3.Paid Shuttle autos from entrance for those who can't walk ( not very sure. Ask the security or call temple. If you are coming by auto or uber you can ask them to drop up the hill they will allow without parking fee. If you have a private vehicle it's very good. Nevertheless it's a good exercise for people coming by metro or bus) 4. Direct exit for people not interested in shopping. There is a clear big LED board which shows direction for direct exit. Many people are complaining that you are forced into stalls. Nobody forces. There is an exit and you should just take that. 5. Buying books paraphernalia etc is optional. Again for those who feel it is a commercial shopping complex you can just take lift or walk away from counters. However their books are amazing and very inspiring. 6. Lot of books and things to engage school going kids into God consciousness. 7. Free meal everyday 11am to 2pm 8. Free Donna (cup) prasada of steaming hot kichidi. You can ask for any number they don't mind. 9. Weekdays you can have peaceful darshan for a longer time 10. You can buy tickets for a queue free closer darshan 11. Clean toilet facilities provided backside of temple 12. All prasadam ( pastries puffs) items are free of onion garlic and eggs obviously 13. Enquire about events in the temple like youth programs , summer camps etc. If you are interested. 14. On certain festivals like Narsimha jayanthi, panihati etc ( you can get to know thru their website about upcoming festivals) the evenings are marvellous. Must visit festival evenings at 6 30pm usually in the open air theatre. 15. Observe the way the Deities are decorated. I am sure no temple in Bangalore have such nice outfits and such decoration for deities that too EVERYDAY. 16. Car park, Guest house, Higher taste restaurant, animated movie Little Krishna shows, pooja paraphernalia, authentic books based on Scriptures, coloring books, kids books, school stuff, bakery... Many more. 17. If you donate even a rupee here, it is completely worth as they spend on free midday meals to school kids all over India. And their transactions are clear so you don't have to worry whether somebody is eating you money. They use all donations for seva of Lord. 18. Anybody can visit temple irrespective of race caste creed. No shorts allowed. U can rent dhoti.",5,POSITIVE

Its huge and architecturally a great structure, well planned and executed. Old people with knee problems should give it a miss as the number of steps are too many but that is purely due to the hilly nature and crowd management. Everything is systematic, right from depositing your shoes, hand wash and crowd management is awesome till the main temple area.(Though I didn't like the chanting on each step). Once the darshan is completed, now starts the real fun, chaos and mis-management. The temple suddenly turns into a food court, shopping mall, selling you t-shirts, paintings, souvenirs and snacks. Sometimes you find people loitering on the floors making it difficult for you to walk and food crumbles attracting flies and ants. A complete mis-management here. Its always a tourist attraction and yes I have visited the place more than a couple of times just due to the demand from different family members and my attraction are the snacks and sweets served there.",4,POSITIVE

4984,Trip Advisor,Rajesh Kumar R,5/24/17,Sunday visit,We visited the temple on a rainy evening. What stands out first is the nearly organised car parking. The entire temple complex is a series of vegetarian food shops on the ground floor...Ranging from over the counter snack shops to exorbitantly priced fine dining. Start climbing the stairs and you will be impressed with the semi modern architecture. Also the queues are efficiently organised and within 15 minutes you are in the main hall. The main hall is grand. A huge capola with frescos from the life of Krishna will keep you mesmerised till you reach the main shrine. For Rs. 150 per family you can break off from the regular line and get a family Darshan right in front of the deity. The way back winds through a series of outsourced counters where vendors try and sell you just about anything with branding of Krishna on the goods. That kills the euphoria and spirituality you felt a few moments back. TIP : The samosas stall on the way out has a good fare.,5,POSITIVE

5023,Trip Advisor,amaranth189,6/2/17,A Holistic Place that Relaxes you instantly,"ISKCON has two temples in Bangalore, of which the one at Hare Krishna Hill in Rajajinagar is the more popular one. A large complex built in the Dravidian style, this temple sees a heavy rush from devotees particularly on weekends and during festivals, hence, one needs to plan to spend time before going. The temple has beautiful fountains and carvings. The idols are all well-crafted (refer to the pics of the same on their website). There are also food stalls, book stores and stalls for devotional items, as common with other ISKCON temples. The prasadam is extremely tasty and hygienic. The temple is kept clean by the volunteers. One needs to deposit one's bag etc. before entering. Parking can be an issue during peak hours, but considering the place is a short walk from the nearby metro station and Yeshwantpur bus and railway stations, getting here is not much of an issue.",5,POSITIVE

The ISKCON has many small temples in it. once you are in front of the main temple, you can see amazing view of Bangalore. I think photography is prohibited in the temple premises. When you enter the bhajan hall, you will get a amazing feel. all will be in prayers. Securities will push you before you pay or see lord Krishna. I could see the people who came in 100 rupees pass, the priests treating then royally, for others securities treated like slaves. The temple has big canteen, they provide 3 time free food. Also they has big bakery inside the temple, so you can buy sweets from there. The best time to visit the temple is morning 5-30 to 7.30",1,NEGATIVE

Once you have had the darshan you will be made to walk through all the different stalls they have which became tiresome for my aged parents. You will also be given prasad after you finally come out of the temple. The main shrine is however beautiful and you can offer pushpanjali also by paying some amount. The time we went the temple was very crowded however the management was good and we did not face much issue. Also by buying some special darshan tickets you can opt for skipping the crowd. Another thing the temple had a dress code board on display which said ladies wearing only saree, salwar or kurti would be allowed in....however we found ladies wearing jeans also going (though they were few in number).....however one girl wearing three-fourth was stopped at the entrance.",5,POSITIVE

Add to it the chants of Lord's glory echoing through the huge hall having beautiful murals depicting the pass times of Krishna. Seems as if it's real or everything is a passing dream not to be woken up. Pure bliss. One can buy the special darshan tickets for group of 4 or 6 person, which entitles speedy darshan including at Narasimha, Balaji and finally the Radha Krishna along with Nitai Gauranga and Krishna Balarama in main temple, by passing the queues. This pass also gives privilege to offer prayers (archana) and take prasads and books. However I would recommend going in normal queue, which gives the privilege of chanting ""Hare Krishna"" mantra 108 times with other devotees as one climbs to the temple. Everyone is served a bowl of prasad at the exit and on Sundays it's lunch (satvik and tasty). However there are many snack items available just before the exit one can buy, like samosa, kachori, rasagola, gulab jamuns, pizza slices, burgers, sandwiches, juice. Souvenir shops aplenty to satiate your yearnings to keep memories of visiting ISKON at Bangalore.

You can take the blessings of Lord Krishna and know about the Vaishnava culture. There is a book stall from where you can purchase holy books for reading. The temple has a canteen and shopping area where you can feed yourself with a variety of vegetarian food and buy some handicraft material as well. This temple offers everything you look for on a weekend outing. It's peaceful and divine. The only flip side is that the temple remains very crowded during weekends and other festivals.

The main temple sanctum has high positive energy and vibes. We as a society lack self discipline and that creates chaos in the temple. The guards have to run around to stop people from photographing. The only thing which I don't prefer in a place of worship is commercial sales. One can definitely provide religious literature and books in and around the temple but selling merchandise on multiple counters like market doesn't go well within the temple. There can be a dedicated area for these commercial activities. People who go to visit temple must be given direct entry and exit without forcing them go through all these sales counters.

5331,Google + HK HILL,Anand Prakash Jangid,7/5/17,NA,"ISKCON at Bangalore is like a haven of peace and piety, amidst the hustle and bustle of a busy cosmopolitan city. The air itself calls out 'Krishna', even if the taped chants of 'Hare Krishna' weren't played at a loop. The first thing that strikes one about the temple, is the breathtaking majesty of its facade - this is one of the most beautifully designed Krishna temples ever! Situated high above a hill, so be prepared for climbing stairs, the Temple itself commands a panoramic view of the city, from the right side of the sanctum area. Remember the dress code and wear covered clothes - I was in a short sleeved dress, so wore long pajamas underneath to cover up. Also check the temple's timings before you go, it closes during the afternoon. There are toilet facilities (a bit better than primitive) that can be used if there is an absolute need to go. Shoes can be checked in at the shoe racks (hold your nose though, because that area smells of feet!), but to me, the best part is the luggage counter, because you can visit the temple and then go straight to the airport/railway station if you're so minded. There are a 108 steps that one is advised to stop at and chant the complete 'Hare Krishna' mantra for awakening inner consciousness and focusing on Krishna. Two smaller sanctums devoted to 'Prahalada' and 'Prabhupada', lead you on to the majestic main sanctum, which is done up in gold and will elicit an audible wow from most first timers. Onwards from the 'darshan', and there is a book counter, and the exit ways lead to other halls where one can purchase jaap maalas (Hindu rosaries), crystal trees, incense and essential oils, and a whole lot of other things besides. There is a lovely bakery too, and a proper Cafe, aptly names 'The Higher Consciousness'. Free prasadam that's basically made of sweetened tapioca pearls, and you can then take your leave, or stay for longer. It took me about an hour, at a rush, including the 108 chants, so perhaps one would be better advised to keep aside atleast a couple of hours for this beautiful sanctuary of inner consciousness.

At least I don't get a divine feeling when I visit because of the constant bustle and too many commercial activity going on.

Most of whom were religious.If you are religious, it is a beautifully built temple which makes you feel peaceful. You are made to chant on each step, patiently waiting in a long queue of devotees. When you reach inside, you can sit in the hall and it feels quiet and nice. You will come out feeling happy.If you are not religious, its a beautifully managed place. You will see such great processes being used to control such a large crowd. No one is pushing or talking or littering. This is because you are made to chant at each step and just take one step at a time. You will come out feeling happy, having learnt a thing or two about religion.",4,POSITIVE

5662,Trip Advisor,jcalv57,8/9/17,Krishna Blessings,"Since my childhood i was always attracted towards the fantasies of Krishna, I was a believer back then , although now my liking towards mother nature and the whole existence and taken over the likes of Gods and Goddesses, yet the fact is the time i visited Iskcon temple I used to be a great believer in deity worship. For the first time when i went there i was excited and blindly devoted because i have always loved to visit temples , the peace that i get in the chanting of manthras and the smell of Agarbathis and Camphor and not to leave behind the very structures of the idols and the temples have mesmerized me and continue to do so. now coming to Iskcon. The whole of Iskcon temple is like a MALL meant for shopping and looking around. The priests look and talk like they have everyday meeting with Lord Krishna and only they are the rightful devotees of Krishna. Apart from that they treat you like school kids with discipline routines like chanting while getting into the temple. The idols within Iskcon are like showcase material and i would not recommend anyone who is expecting a peaceful retreat of a temple at this complex. Good luck",5,POSITIVE
5656,Trip Advisor,KarthikJay R,8/9/17,My honest Review,"Such an awesome temple! An absolute must visit! Be sure to see Aratik and take some of the wonderful prasad. Most importantly don't leave without a book by Srila AC Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada! Just having a book is most, most auspicious for all the residents of your home",1,NEGATIVE
5669,Google + HK HILL,Krishna Katha,8/9/17,NA,"We visited the Iskcon temple with our two kids. Its has steps leading up to the main temple that might be a little tiring for the old folks. However, nice breeze blows all the time, especially during the evenings when the temple is well lighted. It's dedicated to Lord Krishna but has idols of other deities too. After having the main darshan and coming down the steps, there are small shops selling local savories and snacks, toys, religious books, pictures, idols and a whole variety of items. At the end of the steps, you get piping hot Prasadam in the form of Pongal/ khichdi/ sambhar rice. Outside the main temple but within its premises, there's a sattvic restaurant named Higher Taste. It has a buffet that's worth tasting once since all items on the menu are made without using onion and garlic, though prices are on a tad higher side. Would recommend visiting the temple at least once.",5,POSITIVE
